Merge intervals patterns deals with problems involving overlapping intervals. Each interval is represented by a start and an end time - (startTime, endTime),
This is used to usually solve scheduling problems. 
The key to understanding this pattern and exploiting its power lies in understand how any two intervals may overlap. 

Does my problem match this pattern?
    Input data is an array of intervals?
    The problem requires dealing with overlapping intervals, either to find their intersection, their union or gaps.
