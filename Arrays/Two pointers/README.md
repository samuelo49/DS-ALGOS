Two pointers pattern uses two pointers to iterate over an array or list until problems or conditions are satisfied.
Used whenever there's a requirement to find two data elements in an array to satisfy a requirement.
You can use the two pointers to iterate the data structure in one or both directions depending on the problem you are trying to solve.

Conditions that need to be fullfilled for Two pointers to be a good technique to use:
    -> The input data can be traversed in a linear fashion(array/list, linkedlist, string)
    -> we limit our focus to a specific range of elements within the input data, as dictated by the positions
        of the two pointers, allowing us to consider a small subset of elements rather than the entire set.
