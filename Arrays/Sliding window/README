In the sliding window the two pointers usually move in the same direction and will never overtake each other.
This ensures that each value is only visited at most twice and the time complexity is still 0(n)

The sliding window pattern is used to process sequential data by maintaining a moving subset of elements, called a window. The pattern is aimed at reducing the use of nested loops in an algorithm. It may be viewed as a variation of the two pointers pattern, with the pointers being used to set the window bounds

Why is this method more efficient? It isnâ€™t if, for each window, we iterate over all the elements of the window because that gives us the same O(kn) time complexity.

1. Use two pointers: start and end to represent a window.
2. Move end to find a valid window.
3. When a valid window is found, move start to find a smaller window.
