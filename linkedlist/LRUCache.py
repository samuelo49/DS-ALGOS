"""
Q. Design a data structure that follows the constraints of a Least Recently Used (LRU) cache.

Implement the LRUCache class.
If the number of keys exceeds the capacity from this operation, evict the least recently used key.
The functions get and put must each run in O(1) average time complexity.
