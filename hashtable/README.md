Hash table commonly referred to as hash map implements an associated array abstract data type, where you can map keys to values.

You idealy traverse an array once and hash all elements into a hash table then looking up if the element exits would be 0(1) on average.

Operations on a hash map ( dict in python):
    Searching - 0(1) on average
    Insert - 0(1) on average
    Remove 0(1) on average

Sample Questions:
    1. Describe an implementation of a least-used cache, and big-0 notation of it.
    2. A question involving an API's integration with hash map where the buckets of hash map are made up of linked lists.
