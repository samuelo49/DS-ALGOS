❓ PROMPT
The decimal system uses the digits 0-9, the binary system uses the digits 0 and 1,
and the hexadecimal system uses the digits 0-9 and the letters A-F. The ternary system is a base-3 numeral system that uses the digits 0, 1, and 2.

Given an integer, write a function that converts the number into its base-3 representation. Return the result as a string.

Example(s)
convertToBase3(0) === "0"
convertToBase3(1) === "1"
convertToBase3(2) === "2"
convertToBase3(3) === "10"
convertToBase3(4) === "11"
convertToBase3(-5) === "-12
